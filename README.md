# Notes App

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The app was built for Front-End practise and is by all means not perfect, however it's a great starting point. 
Currently the App's purpose is to take notes and they are stored in browser's local storage.

 

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`
